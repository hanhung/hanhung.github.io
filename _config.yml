  Hello, I am Han-Hung Lee and I'm a student that recently graduated from NTHU with a B.S. degree in the Undergraduate Program of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. A few of my research interests include <mark>3D Point Cloud/Voxel</mark>, <mark>Reinforcement Learning</mark> and <mark>Games</mark>.
# Write an awesome description about yourself here, this supports markdown, so you can add [links](http://foobar.com) and highlight things <mark>like this</mark>.

# You can even add paragraphs by using empty lines like this and add anything else [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started#what-is-markdown) supports such as
#   - Lists
#   - Tables
#   - <a href="google.com">Links</a>

          - Led a 2-person team to create audio reactive visuals using GANs for artistic purposes
          - Mapping frequency changes in songs to traverse the latent space of GANs, forming video clips that react to audio
          - Presented at NeurIPS 2019 Workshop on Machine Learning for Creativity and Design

          - Incorporated Generative Adversarial Networks into a curriculum learning framework for reinforcement learning
          - Environments generated by the GAN is solvable by TD3 agents trained using the proposed curriculum learning framework while the TD3 agent trained from scratch is unable to converge on the BipedalWalker-v2 environment

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
