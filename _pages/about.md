Hello, I am Han-Hung Lee and I am currently a PhD student at Simon Fraser University under the supervision of professor [Angel Xuan Chang](https://angelxuanchang.github.io/). My research interests include `3D Computer Vision` and `Natural Language Processing`. With a focus on `3D representation learning` and `Text to 3D Generation`.

Previously, I received my B.S. degree in the Undergraduate Program of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from NTHU. I have also interned at IIS Sinica under the supervision of [Hwann-Tzong Chen](https://htchen.github.io/) and [Tyng-Luh Liu](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/liutyng/index_en.html).
