#     I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

    - Incorporated Generative Adversarial Networks into a curriculum learning framework for reinforcement learning
    - Environments generated by the GAN is solvable by TD3 agents trained using the proposed curriculum learning framework while the TD3 agent trained from scratch is unable to converge on the BipedalWalker-v2 environment
